This note is from Ken Richards. This repo is a fork of the original, which is no longer supported.
It is useful for testing. There are C++ and Rust repos to look at for "supported" code. (None seem highly advanced.)

run example.py to create the json to send to myscript and also to create an svg so you can see what it being converted.
Change the file for rm0 for different remarkable files
The output will be in rmTempOut.hmac, rmTempOut.json, rmTempOut.svg

Layer ->
    Stroke ->
        Segment
            contains the x,y points

It appears that the sampling happens at constant time intervals of 1 (units?). 
Looking at rm0.out, the stroke had a speed of 1.22 and moved a distance of 1.22, etc..

See https://developer.myscript.com/docs/interactive-ink/1.4/web/rest/architecture/
A segment will correspond with myscript stroke and a Stroke will correspond to an element in StrokeGoups.


The pen is actually stored with every stroke. The penStyle that I was looking at is for display, which we don't use.
// OLD ---
Currently we create a new strokegroup entry for every stroke. We could be smarter and append the strokes to the current one if the pen
hasn't changed, but that is not trivial since the decision would need to be made before we get into Stroke.py where we
have the pen info.
Stroke.py could return a strokegroup entry and the caller could look at the pen to decide to appned the stroke or 
create a new strokegroup entry.
